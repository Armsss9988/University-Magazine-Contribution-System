                              System architecture for your project:
1. Technology Stack:
  Frontend: ReactJS for a responsive and interactive user interface compatible with various devices.
  Backend: NodeJS with Express framework for server-side logic and API development.
  Database: MongoDB for storing user data, contributions, and other system information.
  Authentication: JWT-based authentication for secure access control.
  Cloud Platform: Consider using a cloud platform like AWS or Azure for scalability and ease of deployment.
2. System Components:
  User Interface: Separate interfaces for students, coordinators, manager, and admin.
  Contribution Management: Submission of Word documents and images, editing, and commenting features.
  Faculty Access Control: Role-based access based on user affiliation.
  Review and Selection: Coordinators review and select contributions for publication.
  Download and Reporting: Manager downloads selected contributions and generates reports.
  Guest Access: View-only access for faculty representatives to selected reports.
  Administration: Manage system settings, users, and closure dates.
3. Architectural Patterns:
  Client-Server: Separate frontend and backend for scalability and maintainability.
  RESTful API: Standardized API for communication between frontend and backend.
  Microservices (optional): If the system grows in complexity, consider microservices for modularity and independent development.
4. Security Considerations:
  Implement secure password hashing and storage.
  Enforce proper authorization for different user roles.
  Use HTTPS for encrypted communication.
  Regularly update dependencies and libraries to address vulnerabilities.
5. Scalability and Performance:
  Choose a cloud platform with auto-scaling capabilities to handle varying loads.
  Optimize database queries and caching mechanisms for fast response times.
  Consider load balancing for distributing traffic across multiple servers.
6. Deployment:
  Use a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
  Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) for easier deployment and portability.
7. Monitoring and Logging:
  Implement application and infrastructure monitoring to identify and address issues.
  Log user activity and system events for auditing and troubleshooting.
